## Couresera course: Exploratory Data Analysis<br>
# Week 1 Project<br>
<br>
All you need to do is download the 4 scripts, each script can be run independantly.<br>
<br>
Basics of all 4 scripts:<br>
1. Download the ZIP file (into your working directory from cloudfront as household_power_consumption.zip).<br>
2. Unzip the ZIP file (into your working directory as household_power_consumption.txt).<br>
3. Read unzipped file into table.<br>
4. Create subset of table for 2 days we're working with.<br>
5. Remove object of full table.<br>
6. Add new column for date time.<br>
7. Create histogram and or plot.<br>
8. Write histogram and or plot to png file.<br>
<br>
It would have been faster to create a separate script to do 1-6 but this way you can run any of the scripts on it's own.<br>
