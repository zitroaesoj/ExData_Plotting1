## Couresera course: Exploratory Data Analysis 
# Week 1 Project

All you need to do is download the 4 scripts, each script can be run independantly.

Basics of all 4 scripts:
1. Download the ZIP file (into your working directory from cloudfront as household_power_consumption.zip).
2. Unzip the ZIP file (into your working directory as household_power_consumption.txt).
3. Read unzipped file into table.
4. Create subset of table for 2 days we're working with.
5. Remove object of full table.
6. Add new column for date time.
7. Create histogram and or plot.
8. Write histogram and or plot to png file.

It would have been faster to create a separate script to do 1-6 but this way you can run any of the scripts on it's own.
